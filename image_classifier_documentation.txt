The Main objective of the Flask application is to check whether a particular website is ISO certified or not .

To implement this we need a image classifier model which can detect whether the image is ISO certified. 

We have created a classifier model with Keras with a accuracy of 94%. 

The main backbone of the application is the script.py File 

def check(web,timeout):
	Arguments :
	Two arguments are required which are the Website URL which you want to check
	and the second argument is a timeout of variable which specifies how long do you want the function to run.
	
	Functionality :
	We scrap the entered URL and extract all the Links to the other asscoiated pages.
	Then we go through all this URL pages and the Homepages and collect are the Image URLs and append it to the list.
	
	After we collect the image URL we download those images one by one and check whether that image is ISO image
	If it is ISO certified than it wil :
		return 1 
	if no image it detected as ISO than it will:
		return 0
	if elasped time is greater than the timeout than it will :
		return -1 

Moving on two the main app.py file:
It takes value from the user and pass it on to check function with timeout value 
Based on the Result of the function we decide the output .

All the libraries required are listed in the requirements.txt File.
